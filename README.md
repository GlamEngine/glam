# Glam

This project might be an ES6 WebGL engine built on [stack.gl](https://stack.gl/) and leveraging glTF. Philosophically it tries to combine the small-repo / big-repo philosophies together providing a discoverable collection of utilities. The API is built in a way to be composable with the magnificent tools on NPM, while opinionated and centralized in a way to get things done.
